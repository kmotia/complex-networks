BLACK CONTINUES... ELVISH SINGING....A WOMAN'S VOICE IS
whispering, tinged with SADNESS and REGRET:


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (Elvish: subtitled)
          "I amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,
          han mathon ne chae...a han noston ned
          wilith."
              (English:)
          The world is changed: I feel it in the
          water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
          in the air...Much that once was is lost,
          for none now live who remember it.

          and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

if holding-close a precious secret.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Nine...nine rings were gifted to the
          race of Men who, above all else, desire
          power.

          For within these rings was bound the

FADE UP: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE EARTH...moving

TEASING SHOTS: SAURON forging the ONE RING in the CHAMBERS of
SAMMATH NAUR.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
          Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
          in secret a Master Ring to control all
          others.

          dominate all life.

          One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
          fell to the power of the ring.

ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD...


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
          for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle...


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But the power of the Ring could not be
          undone.

With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge...THE BLACK
MACE OF SAURON LASHES OUT!! IMAGE: ELENDIL'S body falls like

father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.


ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body


GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

          one chance to destroy evil forever.

through DARKENING WOODS...the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN
around his neck.


                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.


SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR
SCREAMS!

FADE UP: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER...as THE RING slips
slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

            It betrayed Isildur to his death.


IMAGE: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of the RIVER
ANDUIN.


                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And some things that should not have been
            forgotten...were lost.


                                                     FADE TO BLACK


                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            History became legend...legend became
            myth.


FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and
undisturbed.


                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And for two and a half thousand years the
            Ring passed out of all knowledge.


IMAGE: SILT SWIRLS...A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down...grasping the RING...


                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
            new bearer!

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.


IMAGE: THE GLOOM of a MOUNTAIN CAVERN..a MURKY POOL of
WATER...in the DARKNESS the SHADOWY OUTLINE of an EMACIATED
FIGURE.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE
          mutters in the half light...


                    GOLLUM
          It came to me. My own.     My love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          My preciousness.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

                       GALADRIEL (V.O.)   (CONT'D)
          It waited.


FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.


SLOW MOTION: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to the
MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But something happened then the Ring did
          not intend...

RING.


                      GALADRIEL
            It was picked up by the most unlikely
            creature imaginable...


                      BILBO
                (to himself)
            What's this?


A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in
his hand...PERPLEXED by what he has found.


                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.


                      BILBO
                (surprised)
            A Ring.


SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the


COLD, DANK TUNNELS...


                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!


Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."


SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.


                    FRODO
          You're late.


CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...


                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.


They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.


                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!


Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.


                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.


                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...


Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.


                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...


Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.


                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.


                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.


                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

          He's up to something.


                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?


Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.


                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.


                       GANDALF
          Indeed?


                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.


                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.


                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.


                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?


                                                       ANGLE ON:


ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

                                                       CRANE UP:


As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

CONTINUED:


The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.


                                                     ANGLE ON:


Excited children, chasing after the cart.


                                                     CLOSE ON:


Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.


                                                     ANGLE ON:


Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.


                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.


                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

EXT. BAG END -- DAY


Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:


                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.


                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?


Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

          Bilbo Baggins!


                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!


Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.


                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!


Gandalf looks at him more keenly.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.


                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY


Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.


                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?


Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.


                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

CONTINUED:
                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...


Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?


Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.


                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.


                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?


                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.


MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)


Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.


                    BILBO
          I'm not home.


Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!


                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.


                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.


                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!


                    GANDALF
          You will tell him, won't you?

          Yes, yes.


                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.


                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING


Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.


                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!


Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,

          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT


BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.


                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.


                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.


                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.


Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.


                                                            15.






ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE


as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.


Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.


                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!


ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S


upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.


                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!


STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework


                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!


Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.


                    MERRY (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!

sizzles angrily.


                     MERRY
          Outside!


                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.


Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!


                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!


                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!


ANGLE ON: FRODO


As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.


ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,


clothes and hair smoking.


                    MERRY
          That was good!


                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!


LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN


Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and

party.

applause.

          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.


SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.


Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.

          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.


Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.


ANGLE ON: FRODO


staring at the empty stool in disbelief.


                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT


The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.


INT. BAG END -- NIGHT


The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.


                                                      ANGLE ON:


Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.


                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?


                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?

                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.


                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.


                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?


                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.


                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?


Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.


                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?


                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?


                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!


ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.


                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.


                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

CONTINUED:




                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.


                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.


                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.


                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!


Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room


                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!


                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.


Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.


                    GANDALF

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.


                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.


CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.


EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT


                                                      ANGLE ON:


Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.


                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."


                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.


                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.


                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.


Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT


CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I

fingers.

          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's

it.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)

          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.


                    FRODO
          Where are you going?


                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.


                    FRODO
          What things?


                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.


                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...


Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.


                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his
Assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia
blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from
much traveling. Hair and beard much longer an unkempt.

suspicious, Alert. Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope
and tosses it into the fireplace!

              (bewildered)
          What are you doing?


Flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring,
as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the
fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.


                    GANDALF
          Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite
          cool.


Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand...he reacts to its
weight.

Mordor?


                    FRODO

In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One

          This is the one ring forged by the dark
          lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt
          Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of

          For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
          Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
          delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
          awoken. It has heard its master's call.

emanates from the Ring.   Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing
the other has heard it.

                    GANDALF
          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up
          the Ring.

Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient
forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the
distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is
clearly visible


EXT. ISENGARD VALLEY -- DAY


Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of
ISENGARD...a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to
rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams
that flow down from the mountains.


                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
          Smoke rises once more from the mountain
          of doom...the shadow takes shape in the
          darkness of Mordor; the hour grows
          late...and Gandalf the Grey rides to
          Isengard seeking my counsel...


The strange tower of Orthanc...hewn from a solid pillar of
black obsidian...rises up in the center of the Isengard
Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs.


                                                            35.






ANGLE ON: SARUMAN, THE WHITE WIZARD


he sweeps down the Orthanc stairs.


                    SARUMAN
          For that is why you have come, is it not,
          my old friend?


Gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his
long ride.


                     GANDALF
          Saruman!

EXT. ISENGARD GARDENS -- DAY


Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees
of Isengard, Saruman's clean, white robe contrasts with
Gandalf's dusty grey robes.


                    SARUMAN
          Are you sure of this?


                    GANDALF
          Beyond any doubt.


                    SARUMAN
          So the ring of power has been found?


                    GANDALF
          All these long years it was in the Shire,
          under my very nose.


                    SARUMAN
          And yet you did not have the wit to see
          it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has
          clearly slowed your mind.


                    GANDALF
          We still have time...time enough to
          counter Sauron...if we act quickly.


                     SARUMAN
          Time?   What time do you think we have?

INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- DAY


Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to
the side of the cavernous central chamber.

                    SARUMAN
          Sauron has regained much of his former
          strength. He cannot yet take physical
          form...but his spirit has lost none of
          its potency. Concealed within his
          fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
          His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
          and flesh. You know of what I speak,
          Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed
          in flame.


                    GANDALF
              (softly)
          The eye of Sauron.


                    SARUMAN
          He is gathering all evil to him.


                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Very soon he will have summoned an army
          great enough to launch an assault upon
          Middle earth.


                    GANDALF
          You know this? How?


                    SARUMAN
          I have seen it.


Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...


                    GANDALF
          A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.


Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.


                     SARUMAN
          Why?   Why should we fear to use it?


                    GANDALF
          They are not all accounted for, the lost
          seeing-stones...we do not know who else
          may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth
          back over the Palantir.

                    SARUMAN
          The hour is later than you think.
          Sauron's forces are already moving...the
          Nine have left Minas Morgul.


                    GANDALF
              (shocked)
          The nine!


                    SARUMAN
          They crossed the river Isen in
          Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.


                    GANDALF
              (alarmed)
          They have reached the Shire? Saruman
          shrugs...


                    SARUMAN
          They will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.


Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.


                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          You did not seriously think a Hobbit
          could contend with the will of Sauron?
          There are none who can.


Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.


                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Against the power of Mordor, there can be
          no victory. We must join with him,
          Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
          would be wise, my friend.


                    GANDALF
              (deadly)
          Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?


At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is
flung to the floor.

          I gave you the chance of aiding me
          willingly, but you have elected the way
          of pain.


Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of Saruman... Commanding two staffs, Saruman
sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. Rushing
POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.

          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,

                    SAM (CONT'D)

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety

undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are

evil and lonely creature.

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.


CLOSE ON: FRODO


Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.


CLOSE ON: FRODO


He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!


Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.


                    FRODO
          How far to the nearest crossing?


                    MERRY
          The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.

houses nestled against a low wooded hill.

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse...wild
eyes, ragged, and out of breath.


                     FRODO
          Come on.


A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.


                    GATEKEEPER
          What do you want?


                    FRODO
          We're headed for the prancing pony.


The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.


                    GATEKEEPER
          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?


                    FRODO
          We wish to stay at the inn...our business
          is our own. To Frodo's relief, the
          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.


                    GATEKEEPER
          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.


The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.


                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          It's my job to ask questions after
          nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
          abroad...can't be too careful.

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.   Frodo attracts
the INN KEEPERS'S attention.

          Excuse me.


                     BUTTERBUR
          Good evening, little masters. If you're
          seeking accommodation, we've got some
          nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
          Mr...ah...


                    FRODO
          Underhill...my name's Underbill.


                       BUTTERBUR
          Underhill?     Hmmmm.


                    FRODO
          We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can
          you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR
          frowns...


                    BUTTERBUR
              (Puzzled)
          Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
              (recognition)
          Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big
          grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with
          relief...Butterbur shakes his head.


                    BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)
          Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
          shocked.

          What do we do now?


INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT


Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                    FRODO
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.


Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.


                    PIPPIN
          What's that?


                    MERRY
          This, my friend, is a pint.


                    PIPPIN
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!


Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.


                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.


A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.


                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.


Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...


                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?


                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.


                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.


BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.


                                                            47.






CLOSE ON: FRODO


Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.


"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:


                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...


ANGLE ON: PIPPIN


sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.


                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.


Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.


                    FRODO
          Pippin!


                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!


Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...


                                                      CLOSE ON:


The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.


VOICE OF SAURON


There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!

                    STRIDER
          A little more caution from you...that is
          no trinket you carry.


                    FRODO
          I carry nothing.

          that is a rare gift.

          Yes.


                    STRIDER
          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.


The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.

lips.

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
          deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of

          nightfall.


                    PIPPIN
          What about breakfast?


                    STRIDER
          You've already had it.


                    PIPPIN
          We've had one, yes...but what about
          Second Breakfast?


Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.


                    MERRY
          I don't think he knows about second
          breakfast, Pip.


                    PIPPIN
          What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon
          Tea, dinner...he knows about them,
          doesn't he?


                    MERRY
          I wouldn't count on it.


An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it.   Another,
aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.

floor. He wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing...rising
onto his knees...lifting his head... Gandalf stands as the
camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of
Orthanc. He is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded
on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP. Another whispering
wail rends the air. Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and
peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being
ripped from the ground by the ORCS. Gandalf looks on in
Horror as ORCS hack into the trunk with axes.

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin race into a RING OF BROKEN
STONES on the summit or Weathertop...the ruined base of an
ancient tower. The hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre
of the Ring, waiting for the first assault... One by one, the
5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move
slowly towards the hobbits. In the center is their
leader...the WITCH KING!


                    SAM
          Back, you devils!


Sam rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at the
Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's
blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...


Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

Strider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's
Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,
blade.

smoke and fire billowing out


of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt
of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep
underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters
into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or
Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at
lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand
close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening.

EXT. PINE FOREST -- DAY


The white horse charges through a Pine Forest. Suddenly 2
Galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind! 2 more
Ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the
chase. Arwen grits her teeth...urges the white horse to
greater speed.

Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground.


Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.


                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws

              (yelling)
          If you want him, come and claim him.


THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads
the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing
faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until
they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle
arms raised!

THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR!


Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing
cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries
them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness...

Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life
slip away.

eyes shut, gasping.


                    FRODO
              (frightened)
          Where am I?


A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the swirl of sound.


                    GANDALF (O.S.)
          You are in the House of Elrond, and it is

Frodo's eyes flicker Open He is lying in bed next to an Open
Window...Dappled sunlight plays on richly carved
timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the
Vista of Fir Trees.

softly puffing on his pipe.    He smiles at Frodo.


                    GANDALF
          Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be
          here, too. A few more hours and you
          would have been beyond our aid. You have
          some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.


Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly...


                    FRODO
          What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you
          meet us?

          Get up! So much for the power of the
          Ring or embrace your own destruction!


With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the
ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.


                    GANDALF
          There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only
          one who can bend it to his will...and he
          does not share power.


SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off
the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from
Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.

          By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
          beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE
          HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's


bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.

          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf

          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...

          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.


                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.


                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.


                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.


FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.


                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.


                                                               70.

             failed.

                       ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
             I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
             Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
             place it could be destroyed.

INT. ENROND'S CHAMBER, RIVERDELL -- DAY


Elrond turns to Gandalf.


                       ELROND
             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of
             Men. They're scattered, divided,
             leaderless.

          He turned from that path a long time ago.
          He has chosen exile.

INT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- NIGHT


Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through
the darkened gallery. Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old
Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.


                    BOROMIR
              (quiet awe)
          The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
          the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
          picks up the sword and gently touches the
          Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
          appears on Boromir's finger...


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Still sharp.


Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          But no more than a broken heirloom.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          replaces the Broken blade, but it
          clatters to the floor. Boromir walks
          away, leaving Strider sitting alone.


Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears
behind him.


                    ARWEN
          Why do you fear the past? You are
          Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You
          are not bound to his fate.


                    STRIDER
          The same blood flows in my veins...the

Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell... still
and quiet.


EXT. RIVENDELL WATERFALL -- NIGHT


Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge...the Evenstar at
Arwen's breast shines in the moonlight.


                    ARWEN
              (Elvish: with subtitles)

          Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.   I thought
          I had strayed into a dream.


Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's
temples.

              (quietly)
          You said you'd bind yourself to me,

          one lifetime with you than face all the
          ages of this world alone. Strider looks
          down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.

          I choose a mortal live.

Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY


Elrond addresses the council...


                    ELROND
          Strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. You have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...


Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.


                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.


Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.


                    BOROMIR
              (shocked)
          So it is true!

          The doom of man!


                    BOROMIR
          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!


                    STRIDER
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.


                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?


Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...


                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.


Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.


                    BOROMIR
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

          Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

          Gondor needs no king.


                    GANDALF
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.


                    ELROND
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.


                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?


Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.


                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we


                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.


Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice


                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.


                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.


                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?


                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?


Gimli leaps to his feet!

          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow


motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows

          Never trust an Elf!


CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.


                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!


CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.


                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

faces.

          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!


                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.


                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...


                    MERRY
          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

          Nine companions ... so be it.

          You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

          Great.   Where are we going?

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN


Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather
Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.


                    BILBO
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!


Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.


                    FRODO
          It's so light!


                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.


Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.


CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:




Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!


                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.


Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

                    GANDALF (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road

          Thanks.


CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....


                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.


                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.


Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.


                    SAM
          What is that?


                    GIMLI
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

          little cover


there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.


                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?


                    BOROMIR
          It is a strange fate that we should

Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum
vibrates on the soundtrack. CLOSE ON: a Weird beatific smile

Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring
back to Frodo.

EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY


Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir
and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled
out Shivering and Fearful.

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and
greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between
the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of
luminous silver running through the stone.

          Do not disturb the water.


Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.


Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.


                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...


Gandalf raises his eyebrows...


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?


                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.


With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....


INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT


The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.


                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!


A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.






                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    BOROMIR
              (grimly)
          This is no mine...it's a tomb!


                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.


                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!


The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.


                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.


EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT


Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.


                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!


                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!


Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.


INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT


With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.


                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.


                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.


INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT


They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.


                                                      CUT TO:


INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT


The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.


                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.


LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.


CLOSE ON: FRODO


He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.


                    PIPPIN

          What?

          I'm hungry.


Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.


                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.


                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.


                    FRODO
          Gollum!


                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.


TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.


                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?


                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.


Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.


                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.


                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.


                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.


                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.


                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.


                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!


                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)

INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY


The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...


                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light


blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...


                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above


their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.


                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!


Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...


                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY


Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...


                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!


Gimli sobs.


Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.

            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.


Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...


                      LEGOLAS
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.


                      GANDALF
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."


Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!


INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY


Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.


                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!


ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.


They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...


                       SAM

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.


Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.


                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!


Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.


                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!


BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.


                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.


The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

          He's alive!

          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.


                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.


                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?


A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...


                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!
          This foe is beyond any of you!
              (urgent yell)
          Run! Quickly!

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY


The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.


                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.


Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.


THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.


                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY


The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with
fissures that spit flame.


                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!


They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!


                    FRODO

          Gandalf!


                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.


Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of


flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!


                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (booming)
          You shall not pass!! The Balrog places
          one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and
          Boromir race forward, swords drawn.


GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF
STRENGTH!

CONTINUED:


He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips


                    FRODO

          Fly, you fools!


CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries
out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.

The Fellowship tumble out of the Great Eastern Gate on to a

          Legolas, get them up!

          By nightfall these hills will be swarming
          with Orcs! We must reach the woods of

          Frodo?   Frodo!

devastated face. The Fellowship marches on.

forest can be seen...Lothlorien!


EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK


WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks
nervously around...


                    GIMLI
          Stay close, young hobbits..they say a
          Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
          witch of terrible power. All who look
          upon her fall under her spell...

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish
captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.

          The dwarf breathes so loud we could have

          Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We

                    HALDIR
          You have entered the realm of the Lady of

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.


Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP


step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...


                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
          him.


Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (softly aloud)
          ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
          looks to Aragorn.


                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The Quest stands upon the edge of a
          knife. Stray but a little and it will
          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.


Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.


                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
          now and rest for you are weary with
          sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes
          turn to Frodo...her voice fades.


                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Tonight you will sleep in peace.

          Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... CLOSE ON:
          FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT:
          GALADRIEL as she is on the other


side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a
Piercing white light surrounds her.

EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT


Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on
soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL
SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

          What do they say about him?


                    LEGOLAS
          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.


                     ARAGORN
          Take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.


Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.


                    BOROMIR
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          is hope left. But I cannot see it...it
          is long since we had any hope.


CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

          I have seen the white city..long ago.

sadness only when Boromir looks away.

LATER....


The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT


Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.


                      GALADRIEL
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.


                      GALADRIEL
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.


Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

          Gandalf!


Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.


IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.


                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.


Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.


                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.


                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.


                                                   (CONTINUED)


                                                         104.
CONTINUED:




                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.


Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.


                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...


Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.


                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.


                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...


                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.


Frodo realizes what her message is.


                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.


                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.


The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.


                                                      CUT TO:

INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY


Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean
intelligence.


                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?


                    LURTZ
              (gutteral rasp)
          Saruman.


INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY


QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.


                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.


                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.


EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY


Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.


EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN


The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.


                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:




As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...


                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.


EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY


The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.


EXT. FOREST -- DAY


The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.


EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY


A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.


EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN


The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.


                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.


Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.


                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...


Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.


                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.


The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:




Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...


EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY


ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP


As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.


                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.


                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.


                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.


                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...


Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.


                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.


                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.


                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.


Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...


                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.




                                                  (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:




Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...


                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?


Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!


EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY


Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....


                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?


Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?


Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.


                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.


                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?


Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.








                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:




                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?


                    FRODO
          There is no other way.


                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...


                    FRODO
          No. . .


Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.


                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.


                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.


                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.


Frodo turns to leave.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.


Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.


                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!


                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.


                      BOROMIR (CONT'D)

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY


                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:


FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:


                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...


Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!


SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF


LIGHT.


SAURON (V.O.)


(IN BLACK SPEECH)


They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...


EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY


Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.


                                                            111.






AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!


Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.


                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?


                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...


                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?


Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.


                       FRODO
          Stay away!


                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.


                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?


Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?


                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.


                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.


Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.


                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!


Frodo hesitates.

          Run! Run!!


Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!


Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.


EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY


Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.


                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!


Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.


                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!


Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.


                    MERRY (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!


Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.


                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!


                       PIPPIN
          Come on...


Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...


                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?


                                                 (CONTINUED)

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.


                    MERRY
              (softly)
          He's leaving.


                        PIPPIN
          No!


Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.


                        MERRY
          Pippin!


THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.


                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!


                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!


Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...


                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!


Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.


                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!


Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.


                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
          of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?


                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.


Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.


                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.


                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.


                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.


                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.


                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..


                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...


                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...


Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.


                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
          and Kisses Boromir's forehead.

           Legolas and Gimli appear behind
           him...Aragorn stands.


                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.


EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY


On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...


                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!


Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.


                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...


Tears fall down Frodo's face...


                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.


With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.


                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the


shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself


                        FRODO
           No, Sam.


Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.


SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.


Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.


                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!


                    FRODO
          You can't swim.


Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...


                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!


Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.


                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.


                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!


Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..


The two Hobbits row through the water...


EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY


Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.


He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.


Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.


                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...


                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.


                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.


                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.


Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.


                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.


                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.


                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!


Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.


EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY


Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.


A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

          road.


                    SAM
              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.


                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.


                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.


                     FRODO
          Sam?


Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away

                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo.

                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away.

                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes

                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing

                         And where is your skulking friend? That 
                         gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured 
                         look.

                         [The merest hesitation.] There was no 
                         other.

                         We set out from Rivendell with seven 
                         companions. One we lost in M�ria. Two 
                         were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, 
                         and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son 
                         of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

                         Yes... for my part.


                                     FARAMIR
                         It will grieve you then to learn that 
                         he is dead.

                         you would tell me. [Pause] He was my 
                         brother.

                         hidden in the bushes.] They wait for

                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp

                         Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum

                         too small to understand why. But I think, 
                         Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
                         Folk in those stories had lots of chances 
                         of turning back only they didn�t. They 
                         kept going because they were holding 
                         on to something.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.


FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.


                        FRODO
            For what?

about its feet.


ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie

             Only, you've never done a hard days work.


MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,

             The salted pork is particularly good.

           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.


WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.






                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.


                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.


                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .


GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .


                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.


THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .


                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!


PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...


                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!


RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who

             I am happy for you.


EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                        THEODEN
             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.


EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

             Oh, you can search - up and down

          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them

            Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
            He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
            and who makes up nasty lies!


SAM makes for SMEAGOL again . . . with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.


                       SAM
            You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
            your head in!


FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

            Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.


SAM pulls away from FRODO . . .


                       SAM
            I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
            won' t wait around for him to kill us !


                       FRODO
                 (fierce whisper)
            I'm not sending him away.


SAM stares at FRODO . . . at a loss.


                       SAM
            You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!


                       FRODO
                 (lowers voice)
            We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
            without a guide. I need you on my side.

           I know, Sam, I know.

           You must trust me.


FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.


                      FRODO (cont'd)
           Come, Smeagol.


GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.


                      LEGOLAS
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.


LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.


                      LEGOLAS (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .


Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .


ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .


MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.


                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?


With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...


                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?


                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.


                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!


PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.


                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!


As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT


PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .


THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.


PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.


                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!


GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .


The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;




ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF

FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames.

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .


                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.


ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.


GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.


                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.


The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .


                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.


THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

TIRITH.

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.


With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.


A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the

             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.

KINGS carved in cold STONE.


GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.


At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.


At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and

            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield

           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT


ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.


                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?


WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.


                      GANDALF
          You're in the service of the Steward now -
          you're going to have to do as you're told,
          Peregrin Took . . .

                     PIPPIN
          It's so quiet.


GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.






                     GANDALF
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.


                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
          is even worse.                                L
               (tense)                                  :
          Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
          Sam?


GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged
MOUNTAINS of MORDOR . . .

             There never was much hope.


PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self-deprecating smile . . .


                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.


GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR . . .


                       GANDALF V/0
                  (grim)
             Our enemy is almost ready, his full
             strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men
             as well.

             answer Mordor' s call.


ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now ..
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.




                       GANDALF
             This will be the end of Gondor as we know
             it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
             hardest.

             If the river is taken, if the garrison at
             Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
             city will be gone.

GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing ...

ANGLE ON: MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY
KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME,

FRODO falls to the GROUND.


AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.


The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

                  (reasonable)
             I do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.


                        FARAMIR
             What would you have me do?


                       DENETHOR
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor
             unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.


                        FARAMIR
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.


                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?


CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.






                        FARAMIR
                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been
             exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had
             lived?


CLOSE ON: For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate,
then ...

                        DENETHOR
                 (coldly)
            Yes, I wish that.


                       FARAMIR
            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
            what I can in his stead.


ANGLE ON: FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, then turns to leave,
stops, turns back ...


                       FARAMIR (cont'd)
            If I should return ... think better of me,.
            father.


                       DENETHOR
            That will depend on the manner of your
            return.


DENETHOR continues with his meal. FARAMIR exits.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - DAWN


AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.


SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.


CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.


SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.


GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD
. .. Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM.


ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over
the cliff.


CLOSE ON: SAM'S EYES flick open . . . GOLLUM spins around,
caught off guard . . .

                        SAM
             What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?


                        SMEAGOL
                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.


                        SAM
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is
             all.
                  (peering over the cliff's edge)
             What were you doing?


                          SMEAGOL
                  (sly)
             Sneaking!


Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.


                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.


SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -


                        SAM (cont'd)
             Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
             moving on.


SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.


                        FRODO                              .
             It's dark still.


                        SAM
             It's always dark here -


CLOSE ON: SAM stops rummaging . . . SHOCK on his face.


                        SAM (cont'd)
             It's gone . . . the Elven bread!

SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM ...


                      SAM
                (dawning realisation)
           He took it! He must have!


                      GOLLUM
                (shocked)
           Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol
           hates nasty Elf bread!


                     SAM
           You're a lying wretch! What did you do with
           it?


                      FRODO
           He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
           it.


CLOSE ON: GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM'S JACKET . . .
sending LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN!


                      GOLLUM
           What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
                (fake outrage)
           He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
           always stuffing himself when Master's not
           looking!


                       SAM

SAM is ENRAGED . . . he throws himself at GOLLUM .. punching
him!

FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!


CLOSE ON: SAM'S horrified face!

            Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
            go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's
            rest up a bit.


SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO ...

           No, no, you're not alright! You're
           exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
           place; it's that thing around your neck. I
           could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a
           while - share the load.


CLOSE ON: A terrible light comes into FRODO'S eyes as he
STARES into the EARNEST eyes of SAM.


                       FRODO

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .


GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.


                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?


                       LEGOLAS
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.


MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...


EOWYN steps back, laughing ...


                        MERRY
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

             It isn't even sharp.

             Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.


EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT


As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are
sitting nearby, finishing a meal ... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

             To the Smithy .- go!


MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.


                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.


                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.


                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach

             Why should Merry be left behind? He has as
             much cause to go to war as you.
                  (to herself)

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .


                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.


                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends

          They answer to no-one.

                        GIMLI
             What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?


                       LEGOLAS
             One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.


SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES.                                     '

               (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.


Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.


                     LEGOLAS
               (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.


AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR.


                         GIMLI
             Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

                        THEODEN
             It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
             None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

             I will say no more.


KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .


MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.


SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has

SADDLE!

The NAZGUL circle LOW over the CITY, like VULTURES seeking
doomed men's flesh. SOLDIERS are plucked into the AIR by
SHRIEKING NAZGUL and dropped to their DEATHS hundreds of FEET
BELOW. TOWERS and BUILDINGS are DESTROYED. CHAOS as SOLDIERS,
WOMEN and CHILDREN DODGE falling MASONRY.

approaching TOWERS and TROLLS.

             Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls! Kill
             the trolls! Bring them down!


TOO LATE! The TOWERS reach the walls, their DOORS crashing
down, releasing ORCS directly onto the LOWER LEVELS.


As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realises PIPPIN has
come down from the CITADEL . . .


                        GANDALF (cont'd)

             This is no place for a Hobbit!


GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC
with EASE ... BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF
... PIPPIN instinctively slashes his SWORD at him.


ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns on PIPPIN, smiling despite himself.

of TORN and WEATHERED ROCK.


AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of mountain-
stone . . . and in the SHADOWS at the base of the TOWERING ROCK
lies a TUNNEL.


FRODO reacts to the FOUL STENCH coming out of the BLACK HOLE.

             Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.


CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL sensing his PLAN unravelling. Everything
depends on FRODO going inside the TUNNEL


                        SMEAGOL
             It's the only way.

over his hooded eyes ...


Drawing a DEEP BREATH, FRODO follows GOLLUM into the TUNNEL.

             Orcses filth! Orcses come in here
             sometimes.


They continue on, deep into the DARK TUNNEL . . . FRODO is
feeling his way in the dark, following the SOUND ,of GOLLUM'S
scampering.                                            .,;

             It's sticky . . . What is it?


GOLLUM is nowhere to be seen ... only his voice echoes back
down the LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.

INT. SHELOB'S TUNNEL - DAY


FRODO is running BLINDLY . . . He falls, trapped in the sticky
substance which CLINGS to him. As he lays on the ground,
unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if froma distant-;,,
memory . . .


                     GALADRIEL V/0
           I give you the light of Earendil - our most
           beloved star. May it be a light for you in
           dark places when all other lights go out.


CLOSE ON: FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him
. . . he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL - his GIFT from GALADRIEL -
he holds it aloft.

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!


CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.


SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.


ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.


SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!


She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.


SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.


SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!


SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!


ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing
to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!


TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW
TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

ANGLE ON: FRODO as he SLASHES WILDLY with STING. The SHINING
BLADE of STING as it hacks through the FIBROUS STRANDS. They
whip and snap back into FRODO'S FACE as he cuts himself free.


ANGLE ON: Back up the TUNNEL - lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL -
SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches . . .


CLOSE ON: GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING
slashes through the WEB ... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB
gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS::.. . . .


FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees
himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT.

             do it.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed
. . . as MOURNERS beside a bed of death.


DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS.

through her! HEAVING up. again, she wrenches herself away from
the PAIN ... her LIMBS writhing beneath her.

WITCH-KING'S FACE! EOWYN'S SWORD SHATTERS into MANY SHARDS!


The WITCH-KING topples back DEAD, a BLACK OOZE leaking from
his ROBES and ARMOUR! A shuddering CRY, fading into a SHRILL
WAIL passes with the WIND.


ARAGORN and LEGOLAS battle the ORC - LEGOLAS JUMPS onto the
BACK of a GIANT MUMAKIL bringing it down ... he lands on his

                      KING OF THE DEAD

PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the

fix on something.

                          PIPPIN
             Merry ...?


MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN ... HORROR and SHOCK erasing
all other memories from MERRY'S mind ... tears fall down
PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND . . .

TILT UP . . . to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.


                        SHAGRAT
             Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
             mine.


                         GORBAG

lungs!


ANGLE ON: The FOUR URUKS . . . they see a HUGE DISTORTED SHADOW
on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!


SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their
wits - he slays THREE ... YELLING:

CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM . . . they STOP DEAD . . . STARING AHEAD:


ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.


With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .


. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...


                      SAM
           We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.


ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .


                      FRODO
           There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.


THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!


SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.


                       SAM
             We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.


EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY


CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.


                        GANDALF
             Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.


He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .


ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .


                       ARAGORN
             If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.


CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .


                    GANDALF
          It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.


GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .


                    GIMLI
          Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?


GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.


                    GANDALF
          Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

             No.


GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .


                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.


                        GANDALF
             How?


                        ARAGORN
             Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march

          How do you pick up the threads of an old
          life? How do you go on, when in your heart
          you begin to understand. There is no going
          back. There are some things that time
          cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.
          That have taken hold.


ANGLE ON: FRODO . . . from behind. He is HUNCHED over a DESK...

           Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
           end - that each of us must come and go in
           the telling. His part in this tale was now
           over. There would be no more journeys for
           Bilbo. Save one.

                      FRODO O.S.
           To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
           accorded you a special honour. A place on

             Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
             ring of mine ... the one I gave you?


                        FRODO
                  (quietly)
             Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.


                        BILBO
                  (frail)
             Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
             one last time.                                   �

             Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
